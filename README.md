# Vue3, Vite, and TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate for creating Vue3 applications using the Vite build tool and TypeScript language.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, simply clone this repository and install the dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/vue3-vite-typescript-boilerplate.git
cd vue3-vite-typescript-boilerplate
npm install`

You can then start the development server:

`npm run dev`

This will start the server at http://localhost:4000.

## Building for Production

To build for production, run:

`npm run build`

This will create a `dist` folder containing the optimized production build.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of this boilerplate is as follows:

`├── public
│ ├── favicon.ico
│ └── index.html
├── src
│ ├── App.vue
│ ├── main.ts
│ ├── assets
│ │ └── logo.png
│ ├── components
│ │ └── HelloWorld.vue
│ └── styles
│ └── main.css
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.js`

The `public` folder contains the static assets and the `src` folder contains the application source code.
